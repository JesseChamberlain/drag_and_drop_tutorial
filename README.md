# README

This repository has all the code necessary for starting a React on Rails application
including testing. To get started, just clone the repository down and get started using
React on Rails like you normally would.

## Areas in the Boilerplate to Update
Be sure to search `boilerplate` within your project and update any references to
boilerplate with the name of your application. If you do not follow this step, your
application may not behave the way that you expect it to.

## Tutorial steps
